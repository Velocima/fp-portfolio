		<p>
			I am a self taught Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for creating bespoke, elegant
			websites. In 2017 I graduated from the University of Birmingham with a Bachelor's Degree
			in Mathematics. My coding journey began shortly after through the Codecademy Web
			Development course where I found fulfilment in the flow of coding. Since then I have
			expanded my skill set and created professional websites for several local businesses. In
			the future I hope to advance my knowledge enough to contribute to new and exciting
			technologies.
